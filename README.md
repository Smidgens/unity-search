Generic search algorithms for Unity.

# 🎯 Goals

* Implement standard boilerplate for common algorithms while staying as generic as possible to allow for a multitude of use cases through extensions.


# ℹ️ Features

* Fairly low level and use-case agnostic - extensible through custom heuristics.
* Reasonably performant. 🤞

## Algoritms

* A*


**⌛ Future**

* Common search algorithms (binary search)
* Common graph algorithms (depth-1st, breadth-1st,...)
