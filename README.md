<br/>

# 🎯 Goals

* Implement standard boilerplate for common algorithms while staying as generic as possible to allow for a multitude of use cases through extensions.

<br/>

# ℹ️ Features

* Fairly low level and use-case agnostic - extensible through custom heuristics.
* Reasonably performant. 🤞
* Algorithms:
	* `A*`

<br/>

# 📦 Install

1. Open Package Manager
2. Paste GitHub URL:\
`https://github.com/Smidgens/unity-search.git#<version_tag>`

<br/>

# ⌛ Planned

* Common search algorithms such as binary search.
* Common graph algorithms (DF, BF,...)
